# create-your-first-pull-request-ragas-1

For this exercise, I learned my first pull request on Github to my partner. I cloned his repository and modified the file "expectation.txt". After overwriting his file, I pushed it to his repository and did the procedure for pull request. My partner was able to approve my pull request, showing a branch I created on his repository which contains the overwritten file.
